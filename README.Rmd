The goal of `cancerscreening` is to provide a easy way to download cancer screening data from the Kenya Health Information System (KHIS) using R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of cancerscreening from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:
```r
install.packages("cancerscreening")
```

You can install the development version of from [Github](https://github.com) with:
```r

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# Load the package
library(cancerscreening)

# Set credential to make API calls to KHIS
# khis_cred(username = 'KHIS Username')

# Get cervical cancer screening target population by county
target <- get_cervical_target_population(year = 2023, level = 'county')
head(target)

# Download the cervical cancer screening data by county
data <- get_cervical_screened('2022-07-01', end_date = '2022-12-31', level = 'county')
data

# To learn more about the function, run the following command
?get_cervical_screened
```
