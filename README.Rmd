## Overview

cancerscreening provides an R interface to [Kenya Health Information System (KHIS)](https://hiskenya.org) via the [DHIS 2 API](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-master/introduction.html). The goal of `cancerscreening` is to provide a easy way to download cancer screening data from the KHIS using the (khisr package)[https://khisr.damurka.com].

## Installation

You can install the released version of cancerscreening from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```r
install.packages("cancerscreening")
```

And the development version of from [Github](https://github.com) with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak('damurka/cancerscreening')
```

## Usage

### Load cancerscreening package

```{r}
library("cancerscreening")
```

### Auth

cancerscreening will, by default, help you interact with KHIS as an authenticated 
user. Before calling any function that makes an API call you need credentials to 
[KHIS](https://hiskenya.org). You will be expected to set this credential to 
download the data. See the article [set you credentials](https://cancerscreening.damurka.com/articles/set-your-credentials.html) for more

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Set the credentials using username and password
khis_cred(username = 'KHIS username', password = 'KHIS password')

# Set credentials using configuration path
khis_cred(config_path = 'path/to/secret.json')
```

After setting the credential you can invoke any function to download data from the API.

For this overview, we've logged into KHIS as a specific user in a hidden chunk.

### Package conventions

* Most function begin with the prefix `get_` followed by the screening area 
  `cervical`, `breast`, `colorectal`, or `lab`. Auto-completion is your friend
* Goal is to allow the download of data associated with the data of interest, 
  e.g. `get_cervical_screened`, `get_cervical_positive`, or `get_cervical_treated`
* cancerscreening is "pipe-friendly" and, in-fact re-exports `%>%` but does not 
  require its use.


This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
# Download the cervical cancer screening data for country
cacx_screened <- get_cervical_screened('2022-07-01')
cacx_screened
```

### Aggregating Data

These functions are designed to efficiently download cancer screening data at various
aggregation levels (e.g., country, county).  By specifying the desired level, you 
can retrieve only the data you need, reducing download times and optimizing transfer
efficiency.

```{r}
# Download cervical cancer screening data aggregated to country
cacx_screened <- get_cervical_screened('2021-07-01',
                                       end_date = '2021-12-31',
                                       level = 'country')
cacx_screened

# Download cervical cancer screening positives aggregated by county
cacx_positive <- get_cervical_positive('2021-07-01',
                                       end_date = '2021-12-31',
                                       level = 'county')
cacx_positive

# Download Breast mammogram screening aggregated by subcounty
breast_mammogram <- get_breast_mammogram('2021-07-01', 
                                         end_date = '2021-12-31',
                                         level = 'subcounty')
breast_mammogram

# Download Fluid cytology data aggregated by facility
fluid_cytology <- get_lab_fluid_cytology('2021-07-01', 
                                         end_date = '2021-12-31',
                                         level = 'facility')
fluid_cytology
```
